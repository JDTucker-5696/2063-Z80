# Retro Z80 CPU Board

This project was designed to run CP/M 2.2 from an SD card.  It should be an attainable goal for anyone that can solder through-hole parts to assemble it. Note that J10 is an optional header that allows a Sparkfun SD card breakout board [DEV-13743](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/DEV-13743/5881845) to used instead of soldering on the surface-mount SD socket part.

* A youtube playlist discussing this project and how to build your own can be found in [John's Basement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oekucjDcNbA&list=PL3by7evD3F51Cf9QnsAEdgSQ4cz7HQZX5)
* A PDF version of the schematic can be found [here](2063-Z80.pdf).
* Here is the as-built [BOM](2063-Z80.md) with links to the datasheets for all the parts.
* The software for this project will be added as it evolves.
